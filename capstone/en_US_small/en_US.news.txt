The first is the love of self and the second, the love of money. Two Greek words, philautos and philargyros, succinctly express these concepts. Both, I detect, lie at the root of the world's problems. Certainly, this diagnosis is not novel. Why then are these destructive personality traits chronic in the human experience? Further, why are people who possess these attributes permitted to run rampant through communities and societies to the detriment of the greater population? The Protester seeks to curb the second phenomenon.

Though Maryland is the wealthiest state in the country, all Maryland's children are not equal. Maryland is not exempt from the conditions that allowed the Trayvon Martin tragedy to occur. Our battle for equity for all of our children is not just against individuals, it is against established systems and institutions.

There are health disparities in infant mortality and low-birthweight babies. There are educational disparities in academic achievement and disparate administering of school discipline policies such as suspensions, expulsions, and school-based arrests. There are child welfare system disparities that show children of color being removed from home at higher rates than their white counterparts. There are juvenile justice system disparities at every stage from arrest to placement to youth being tried as adults.

A: I think it was absolutely right. What happened with King Crimson is that Ian McDonald and Mike Giles decided that they didn't want to go touring anymore. They decided they just wanted to make records in the studio. And so, they left King Crimson. That was it. The band was over. Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like. But I just don't feel right about carrying on the name King Crimson.
In accusing Adams of failing to live up to his commitment, Cogen cites a letter Adams sent in May 2009 to then-County Chairman Ted Wheeler. In it, Adams commits to a city contribution for the bridge project of $8 million a year for 20 years.

Eurama cautions her against prizing the fabric over the person, a lesson that doesn't quite land, even when McKinley is swept into mourning at an indigo-tinged funeral when Eurama's husband dies. After this, McKinley continues to collect in weighty encounters successive fabrics, traveling along roads and through outposts that she notes were built for imperial extraction. McKinley's description of indigo's history, which often arises as overly deliberate exposition, is best when it appears like this, as it is — underfoot, in the air. Her most difficult procurement comes in the middle of an attempted coup in the Ivory Coast, where she sees herself mirrored in an upper-class African woman carrying, amid chaos over control of wealth, a Chanel purse: "I'm just like her; I'm unable to give up the ghost of the things I hope will fill me with meaning."

TRENTON — A city resident convicted of sexually assaulting his girlfriend’s two little girls was sentenced to 34 years in prison Thursday.
Santorum didn’t. He overthought. He overcorrected. He overdid. He spent so much time explaining the process by which he voted for this, or why he’d originally done that, and the difficulty in his position that led him to do the other, that he never made a positive case for himself.
For the rest of the runners, though, the race was a chance to dress up, join with thousands of friends, old and new, and spend a morning of revelry sweating shoulder-to-shoulder on the city pavement.

Mr. Malouf, who is on his third heart (his first transplant was in 1989 and what he hopes was his last in 2003), says more changes at Petersham are likely; he is working with existing kitchen staff and wants to hire people who are at least as good or better than he is to get through the transition.

But what's most amazing about "American Reunion" is its absolute lack of tonal control.

"The fact is," says Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, "Medicare is going to crush the government, and if Republicans leave it unreformed then the debt picture is very, very ugly. They might never -- literally never -- show the budget reaching balance. Not in the 10-year window and not if they take their graphs out 100 years. Obama could probably show balance just past the budget window in the middle of the next decade because of the massive Medicare cuts he proposes, even if in practice they will never actually happen."

The same, of course, could be said of narrative, which is, at the most basic level, an attempt to impose order on the chaos of experience. That adds another layer of tension to the collection, since stories need some kind of resolution even when what they record is unresolved. For the most part, Doerr does an excellent job of balancing these intentions, creating work that is open-ended yet nuanced, avoiding false connections or epiphanies. The narrator of "The River Nemunas," a teenage girl who moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather after her parents die of cancer, learns that it never gets easier, that the pain of absence is perhaps the only thing that doesn't dissipate. "Lots of things fade away," she thinks, "but ghosts like these don't, heartbreak like this doesn't."

Strangely, the shift in the tight game came courtesy of two huge three-pointers by Holiday in the fourth quarter. With the Sixers leading, 74-73, and Holiday having made only six of 21 shots, the third-year guard rose from 27 feet with the confidence he always seems to have.

Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices, "Chipwrecked" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by "Shrek." But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults, who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and "You Got Served" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot, which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts, the Chipettes, marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano, hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger).

With Ruvo as their host, Cosgrove, along with his wife, Anita, and a handful of other Clinic executives, found themselves as welcomed members of the Las Vegas scene at this year's gala -- it's a scene that Cosgrove succinctly summed up during the charity auction by saying, "It's not Cleveland, is it?"

When it works, though, it is a sight to behold. The Americans looked like a cat toying with a mouse for much of the first half of the final, reeling defenders in only to make the ball disappear with a deft flick or smooth pass to a teammate. Japan's confusion and frustration gave the Americans wide-open spaces in front of the goal, and they easily could have been up 4-0 at halftime.

Asked whether he felt his team was ready for the game, Jones said: "I'd never say that I don't think anybody is ever not ready for a game. Everybody has their own style on how they play, and if they get ready or not. We just have to come out with more fire, especially in day games.

Detectives began re-interviewing witnesses after receiving a Jan. 4 Sun-Times request for all reports on the case.

When you look at the internal data on international tests you find a telling dichotomy regarding American scores. America has a disproportional number of students doing very, very well and a large portion doing poorly. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which administers the PISA test, explains this dichotomy: the number of children in poverty. Twenty-two percent of American children live in mind-numbing poverty, which is far greater than the next highest country. Children do not learn well when they are hungry.

As New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees continues to close in on Dan Marino's single-season passing record, he is carrying his entire team along with him. Brees threw for 412 yards and five touchdowns Sunday in a 42-20 win over Minnesota, leading the Saints to their sixth win in a row. New Orleans had to overcome a sloppy start against Minnesota, including turning the ball over twice deep in its own territory in the first half, botching a surprise onside kick and having a 40-yard TD pass called back because of a penalty. But it mattered little to Brees and the red-hot Saints. Brees now has 4,780 passing yards this season, putting him 304 away from Marino's single-season record of 5,084 yards that he set in 1984. With two games to play, that leaves Brees needing to average just over 150 yards per game. It's hard to imagine Marino's record won't fall.

We also prosecuted the deadliest home arson in Cleveland history under a law that relied partially on the federal Section 8 housing program. Rightfully, the community expected us to use these federal tools to help in those cases.

If you use charcoal, you can arrange the coals in a few different ways. Light your coals as usual.

I’ve been fortunate to cover a few hospital stories over the past year with the Chicago Tribune. While it may sound like an emotionally wrenching assignment, I use the word "fortunate" because I feel that it’s an honor telling the stories of patients going through such hardships.

Linda Wilson: You are right that the left of the two left turn lanes is a continuous flow for traffic to eastbound Manchester. Really the only people that should be stopping in the right left turn lane are those want to cross over to go to West County Mall.

The Four Seasons is a timeless old-style Hawaiian resort — tiki torches, orchid leis and all — which is fine with me. "We absolutely celebrate that fact," Whitfield said.

Since scoring 15 points against Howard in week five, Oakland Mills has scored less points each week since (7, 6, 0). If the Scorpions can score two touchdowns against a Hammond defense that has allowed 73 points in the last two weeks, it would be a small victory at the end of a long season.

Years of experience have taught me that real reconciliation cannot occur without two essential ingredients: trust and truth.

Im not about equality of result when it comes to income inequality. There is income inequality in America. There always has been, and hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be. Why?

So does this mean health-conscious types should pop a Bayer every morning? Possibly, but not necessarily, said Dr. Jack Jacoub, a medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley.
"He's not a very good shot, but that doesn't negate the fact of his intent," Nachtigal said in handing down the verdicts. "He wanted to kill them. He was not successful in his goal, but not for the want of trying. He unloaded the weapon."
Though many Ford workers in Brook Park said they opposed the deal, others said it was the best workers could hope for in a tough economy.
"The gray moved alongside me, crowding me into the rail. I sat chilly, asking for restraint, and Stinger listened, allowing the favorite to go by. I waited. Then waited some more.
The key to cocktails that cool you down on a hot day is in capitalizing on summer's bounty, says Asher, a chef who brings the kitchen into the bar. Whenever possible, use fresh fruit, from watermelon to berries. Also try fresh mint for garnish and the cooling heat of spicy jalapeño for a margarita.

"It looks like too regular a house to give rise to such a character," Cumming said. His favorite Addams Family character? Gomez.
Sandwiches were generally disappointing, and I think the weak bread is to blame. This was true of the grilled cheese and a Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Even the famous cheese toast that Cafe Hon serves its egg salad sandwich on is dry and airy. The best sandwich is the Reuben, which Cafe Hon actually grills instead of throwing under some heat.
Drones come in a variety of sizes, ranging from large aircraft with 116-foot wingspans to tiny craft that can weigh less than an ounce. Under the new FAA rules, civilian drones must weigh less than 55 pounds, stay below an altitude of 400 feet and remain within sight of their operators.

NV Scharffenberger Mendocino County Brut ($19, 12%): This label's marriage with its neighbor, Roederer Estate, continues to pay off. Scharffenberger now might be American sparkling's true outperformer. Even with full malolactic fermentation to soften the texture, this remains fresh and steely. Green apple, poppy seed, grated lemon, morning bun and chalky mineral flavors mesh perfectly.
The ML seats five comfortably; drivers with more passengers than cargo will have to wait until the 2013 model year, when Mercedes will offer it with seven seats. For now, the cargo space is average for this segment, though the rear seats fold completely flat if needed.
Almost forgotten after the sellout crowd calmed down was that the Blues increased their NHL-best point total to 105, staying two ahead of the New York Rangers, who won Tuesday. The Blues put more separation between them and Vancouver, No. 2 in the West with 101 points. They also added distance from Detroit and Nashville, Nos. 2-3 in the Central Division with 97 and 96 points, respectively.

When we've tried to take this series of bumps in the past at higher speeds (above 20 mph) in the regular TRD Tacoma, the results were both jarring and unnerving. It was easy to tell we were running outside the suspension setup's capabilities. However, when trying the same section in the Baja Series, the shocks made all the difference. At 20, 30 and 40 mph, the series of ruts and bumps felt like they were getting smoother. In high-range four-wheel drive, we found the best way to keep control of the Tacoma was to keep the revs high (around 3,000 or 4,000 rpm) in 2nd or 3rd gear (depending on speed) and aim for the tops of the whoops. In fact, after just a short amount of time, it was clear from the feel of the truck that it could do higher speeds as well, which we did.
Feldman: I'm not sure thinking about growth in philanthropy is realistic. So we're thinking a lot more about how to become more self-sufficient and to earn more of our money. Things like the global internet provide opportunities to do that.
Real Madrid could well have lost at Camp Nou and still won La Liga. But actually defeating its eternal rival is something of a game-changer. Mourinho may not admit it, but he didn't just get a monkey off his back, he banished a whole pack of screaming orangutans.

Between 1990 and 2007, when U.S. maritime trade peaked as the recession took hold, there was a fourfold increase in containerized trade through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. In the process, the two San Pedro Bay ports became the nation's busiest maritime gateway. Container traffic through the Port of Oakland, meanwhile, more than doubled.
Defensive coordinator Perry Fewell and his staff. The Giants played exclusively in the nickel Sunday. They switched up the personnel a bit to freshen it up, but they had five DBs on the field for every single play except one, by my count. The loss of middle LB Jonathan Goff has forced Fewell to play mostly nickel this season. But to do it exclusively and to play so well on defense against the Pats for much of the game is a credit to the scheme, the coaches and the players.
Youngblood, who didn't score in the triple jump on Thursday, scored five points for fourth place in the long jump. She got her best jump on her fifth attempt, with a mark of 21-3 1/4.

"I'm drawn to public service," said Bush, who lives in Fort Worth. "Given the opportunity and the stars align, I'd definitely like to consider it. But nothing's on the table right now." Bush said he's "more drawn to state government," with a particular interest in education and "making our taxpayer dollars more accountable to the end user, which is the state taxpayer."
"A woman writer is 'rowing against wind and tide,'" Anne Morrow Lindbergh told her daughter Reeve in 1972, quoting Harriet Beecher Stowe. "We cannot — or only with the greatest difficulty — produce a great 'body of work.'… And it isn't just being a woman. It is some other deeper conflict between art and life." Ultimately, Lindbergh made art from her life; this posthumous collection joins five earlier volumes of diaries and correspondence that explore her experiences with the subtlety and drama of a good novel.

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.
In better times, they've offered a flying car, a submarine, a custom-fitted medieval suit of armor and even an adult-size mermaid suit.

Most cities renew their contracts with the Orange County Sheriff's Department yearly. When the 2013 contracts come up, county officials will ask for no less than a five-year commitment from its 12 contract cities.

Finally, clothes also figure in the humanity of those who tended to the poorest wretches brought aboard the rescue ship Carpathia. Jones quoted from a letter of a passenger who remembered, "I was very busy ... cutting out garments for the steerage and second-class children, some of whom had no clothes at all. We make little coats and leggings out of the blankets."
Beyond the theoretical solutions, the reality on the snow has been gruesome. At Tahoe's Alpine Meadows during the Christmas-New Year holidays, a snowboarder, 25, was found dead in a tree well in wilderness adjacent to the resort. In Wyoming, also during the holidays, a 22-year-old snowboarder crashed into a mother and her 5-year-old daughter who were stopped on a hill, killing himself and the girl. The latest fatal accident occurred Saturday at Granlibakken, a small North Tahoe resort, where a 22-year-old snowboarder from Oakland, Rahsheka Keith, reportedly tried to use her board as a sled, became turned around and rammed into the support pole of a lift tower.
Even so, the mystery has lost none of its allure, consuming marine architects and amateur sleuths alike for decades. Philip Sims, a former U.S. Navy marine architect, says Ballard and his team's discovery opened up "the whole ocean of undersea wrecks," particularly because of revolutionary deep-sea technology. Sims will be a speaker today at the International Marine Forensics Symposium in National Harbor, Md., where attendees will revisit the sinking of Titanic and other famed ships.

In case you've jumped to the conclusion that Pizzeria Ortica may have been inspired by Pizzeria Mozza, I'd say you're probably right. What chef wouldn't want to emulate the success of the Silverton-Batali juggernaut? But Pizzeria Ortica is not a carbon copy. For one thing, the menu includes pasta, some of the best in Southern California, plus a fine antipasti and salad menu, and a handful of well-conceived main courses.
Environmental groups had pushed for curbs on greenhouse gas emissions, blamed for global warming, and challenged the Bush administration for blocking a waiver request from California to pursue more stringent air pollution rules than required by the federal government. The request was granted by the Obama administration last year.
Saturday afternoon, referee Karl Hess ejected two former N.C. State greats — former NBAer Tom Gugliotta and Chris Corchiani — from the Wolfpack's game against Florida State. Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained. It will make everyone's lives much easier. In the instance on Saturday, what is the harm in explaining why Gugliotta and Corchiani were tossed? Or more commonly, where is the downside in giving the reasoning behind a disputed foul call at the end of a game? There is none. Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it.
Raising the direst alarm yet, his administration warned fellow Democrats on Wednesday that if they defeat the tax plan, they could jolt the nation back into recession.

You need to carefully trace each runner back to its source. Then you have two choices: Dig the roots out, or cut the vine off and paint the stump with undiluted Eraser, Weed-Master, Credit 41 or other 41 percent glyphosate herbicide or a 50 percent solution of Roundup.
With weather like this, however, it’s easy to be fooled. Statewide, sunny skies and temperatures in the 60s Wednesday likely had many across New Jersey thinking spring, but for March, it’s pretty much par for the course.

In the near future, science develops a way to make people stop aging at 25. Pretty sweet, except that everyone is also genetically engineered to only live one more year. They can buy more time, allowing the rich go on living at 25 indefinably, while everyone else's clock runs out. Justin Timberlake plays a man accused of murder, who then sets out to shake up the system, with a hostage Amanda Seyfried in tow. Though, pretty sure Timberlake turned 30 this year...
Elmer used a restaurant-quality raspberry jam for the filling, but you can use seedless raspberry jam from the grocery store. Put it in a bowl and whip it up a bit for easy spreading, and spread all the way to the edge of the cake layers.
James Kvaal, the campaign’s policy director, also dismissed Romney’s contention that getting government out of the way by cutting taxes, spending and regulations would spur job creation. “Efforts to cut our way to prosperity have been tried in the past, and Gov. Romney’s vision represents a return to those policies that have failed before,” he said.

“We felt that today’s deal provided us the opportunity to acquire several players that are at or near Major League ready and we could control for five to six years, all of whom have upside potential,” Zduriencik said. “We believe it improves the construction of our Major League roster by adding a right-handed bat and a left-handed arm immediately, and thanks to the young arms we have in our minor league system, we believe that we were able to add talent to our organization while dealing from an area of depth.
While hanging around North Beach and contemplating his future, Bittner, inspired by the eco-friendly writings of Gary Snyder, took to bird-watching. He soon focused his attention on his neighborhood's flock of cherry-headed conures (also known as red-masked parakeets), birds native to South America that either got away from, or were rejected by, their local owners, or escaped during shipment to pet stores. After a long period of patiently building trust, Bittner bonded with the animals, and the results, as captured by filmmaker Judy Irving, are fun to watch. The parrots not only eat out of Bittner's hands, but perch on his shoulders and head as he addresses them by name. Bittner got to know his feathered friends so well that he could recognize individuals, and he happily recounts their stories.
That compared with a surplus of $5.35 billion in March and a deficit of $31.5 billion in February. China often has a large trade deficit early in the year as factories restock after their long lunar new year holiday break.

He was appointed to the Ward B seat on April 6 after Councilwoman Mary Spinello resigned, just weeks before the May 12 election. She had left to head the Jersey City Parking Authority, and the council voted to replace her for the short stretch in what some deemed an inappropriate attempt to give Kenny the "incumbent'' advantage come Election Day.

The Thunder didn't immediately announce whether Harden, who scored 14 points, had a concussion. Bryant and other Lakers acknowledged World Peace is likely to face a multigame suspension with just one game left in their regular season.
But the rule can -- and should -- be your law in your car. Ask back-seat passengers to lock in those seat belts before starting a trip. Far too few of us do that. The LeaseTrader survey indicated only 2 percent of drivers routinely make the safety request over their shoulder. Less than 8 percent ask even half of the time.
“This is an outstanding facility, absolutely outstanding,” Coughlin said. “What I like about it is that the college teams here have been working all fall, so the turf has been broken in well. It’s settled in, and it’s in great shape. It’s going to be great for our players to work out in here all week.”
The late surge before the caucuses for Santorum was the first exhibit, Crawford said. Since then, Republicans elected no self-identified Romney supporters to the Iowa GOP state central committee, Ron Paul backers made a successful play to gain ground within the party structure, the two national committee representatives and state chair refused to sign a delegate loyalty pledge, the party booked a fundraising keynote speaker who has said hes not enthused about Romney, and various outspoken activists have expressed their reluctance about him.
"Ninety-five percent of employees, contrary to popular belief, do their job," said Pagnotta-Murphy, who supervises a small team that maintains city vehicles.
Why do we think Crosby's peeps are behind this? The item reads: "'She is heartbroken, but she is already writing great songs about it,' the pal says. The singer will keep herself busy with an upcoming tour to promote her album Flawz, the friend notes." Way to stay on message.
At a sidewalk picnic table, I talked beer with 5Q regulars Zach Christensen and Heidi Leibbrandt, who make their own brew and grow hops at their nearby home. Christensen, who's "in telecom," nursed a pint of Lompoc's C-Note pale ale, brewed with seven hops that start with "C" (Crystal, Cluster, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Columbus and Challenger). It rates a chart-topping 100 International Bitterness Units, a measure of hop infusion, which Portland beer geeks bandy about the way wine fans talk about grippy tannins.
The airport is also seeking to attract more carriers. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors authorized a $250,000 cash offer to Virgin America to lure it to Sacramento. That money would come from an existing program funded by airport restaurants and shops.

"Ramble At The Ryman"
What advice would you give incoming freshmen? That they should get involved. Getting involved with the things that interest a student will teach him far more than a classroom ever could. I would also tell students to follow their hearts and their passions and that everything else will fall into place. Finally, take every opportunity that is afforded, as one does not know where these opportunities will lead.
And at some point in 2012, he will take them to Baltimore.
Kimbrough traveled to more than 40 countries.

The Institute for Supply Management's better-than-expected report, improving manufacturing data overseas and a surprise jump in U.S. construction spending in June, helped push stock markets higher.

"It's going to take years," Jim Farley, Ford's global marketing chief said at an event at the IAC Building in New York City Monday night.

The newspaper found the agency — which treats the sewage of more than 1.3 million people in Essex, Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties — was being used by its commissioners as a private piggy bank, hiring wives, brothers, in-laws and children; approving special-interest contracts; and hiring of politically connected officials at six-figure salaries.
Kim was not eligible for the Masters. He is not exempt for the U.S. Open. Tuesday was the first time he hit balls since he withdrew from the Texas Open. After one swing, he clutched his right elbow. There was a duck-hook with the driver, another shot that resembled a shank. The other shots were mostly good, though Kim said he still feels a jolt in his elbow even after hitting wedges.
The many theorists out there who believe Cuomo wants President Obama to lose in November in order to abet his own presidential aspirations will find support on Page 25 of the speech, where, when noting the new federal health-care law should cut some insurance costs in New York, the governor failed to give Obama any credit for his signature plan.
A former pilot for Delta Air Lines, Montague spent 15 years flying Asian routes out of Portland until they were canceled. He also flew occasionally to Honolulu from Atlanta but has been to Maui only once.

If we don't start using our own resources and stop trying to be the hero of global warming, we forever will be dependent on other countries for our energy needs. It's time for congressional leaders to stop the EPA from destroying our country from within.
That's a tiny number in relative terms, and the Snake River fish still have to make it to their home lakes in central Idaho. But it's the highest sockeye return recorded at Lower Granite since it was built in 1975, and nearly 25 times the average return of the last 10 years. Ten years ago two sockeye came back.
In an email Tuesday, the Maryland Democratic Party accused Romney of wanting to "go back to the same economic policies that got us into this mess in the first place." Southern Maryland Rep. Steny H.

Toyota's resurgence could mean better deals as rivals fight for customers by offering discounts and promotions. Already, Toyota has announced zero-percent financing and other deals in May.

In addition to accommodations, the deal includes a complimentary wine-tasting card for 30 wineries in Sonoma Valley.
It's gorgeous to look at, but a little incongruous, given the rest of the artist's career. So it makes sense to follow the example of Val Espinoza, a fellow tourist I met on the steps beneath Rivera's allegory. Espinoza and his wife, Rosa, had come from Fresno just to look at Rivera murals, and this was one of three stops for them. (I'll have to check out these two others on my next trip.)

But the pavilion visitors see today was built in the 1950s to replace the original, which was burned down by a crazed monk.

So this is the perfect time for a new bridge, and LeBron is the choice to lay the foundation. He's the league's most gifted player. His resolve has increased. He's 28, the age when youthful energy blends with know-how -- the same age as MJ and Shaq when they won their first.

"This is so surreal I can't even believe this," he said.
Thursday night's scene featured a bit of everything. There were white people, black people, elderly couples, children in strollers and dogs on leashes. T-shirt sellers were getting $10 for shirts with Zimmerman's picture below a huge "WANTED" sign. Other T-shirts read, "I am Trayvon Martin," underscoring the theme of many speakers' comments that anybody could fall victim to a bullet if confronted by someone carrying a loaded gun and claiming self-defense.

The ash cloud, drifting between 20,000 to 30,000 feet (6,000 to 9,000 meters) high and invisible from the ground, initially blocked the main air flight path between the U.S. east coast and Europe. On Friday, the cloud's trajectory was taking it over northern France and Austria and into eastern and central Russia at about 25 mph (40 kph).
"Also, I don't believe it should start at pre-1967, at those boundaries. I disagreed with the president on that, as did Harry Reid in in a speech that night and others. But I think that they are moving towards an agreement on which way to go."

Judy Tisdale suggests serving the salad in bowls, not on salad plates. "Both my grandmother and mother regularly made this salad, as do I. My adult children request it when they come home," she wrote.
Manufacturers of Class 1 devices — gadgets with few or no moving parts, such as tongue depressors, usually have to simply register with the FDA. When the agency allows such devices to go to market, "they aren't passing judgment that one tongue depressor is any better than any other tongue depressor," Maisel says. "They're just saying it's a safe device."
Of his own performance as "The Wild One"-channeling teen rebel Mutt (who turns out to be Indy's son), LaBeouf says this: "You get to monkey-swinging and things like that and you can blame it on the writer and you can blame it on Steven. But the actor's job is to make it come alive and make it work, and I couldn't do it. So that's my fault. Simple."
"I'm sure I could go out and say, `Please, don't do anything negative,'" Romney told Fox News. "But this is politics. And if you can't stand the heat in this little kitchen, wait until Obama's Hell's Kitchen turns up the heat."

What would Jesus do about today's arguments over sexual identity? I don't know. He didn't say. Matthew 7:12 is the best I've found: "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."
Since then we have made other furniture for him -- always with a perch feature that he can curl his talons around comfortably. It's very awkward for him to walk flat-footed. He spends most of the time on a perch on top of the dresser, munching and making quiet, conversational noises. He usually comes twice a day -- an hour or so after sunrise (which makes us avid supporters of daylight-saving time) -- and an hour or so before sunset.
In addition to Cottrell, Foster and her infant daughter, the duplex also was home to Foster's 20-year-old boyfriend, and his 11 siblings, mother and stepfather, according to investigators.

"Fortunately, while I write about the struggle, I wake up in the morning most of the time with a smile on my face, and I've managed to make it to the other side of these things. But I know if I just stay true to the experience, and to what I see as real, it's not gonna leave 'em in a dark place -- it just exposes a dark place. I guess what I'm saying is that it's OK to talk about it. I also think if I explain how hard is has been for me, people don't feel so alone. I know that's my reaction when I listen to sad, hard songs -- 'Oh God, they went through that, too. I'm not so alone.'"

Smith called much of past and current leadership "an elite clique whose sole agenda consisted of nothing more than personal gain and self enrichment." Some of his conclusions, Smith said, were based on personal observations as operations commander of Camp Roberts a few years ago.
Most voters may be unaware of the initiative. It was ordered placed on the ballot earlier this month.

Medical Center in Albuquerque, NM.
The use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences. We should know better by now. After 10 years of combat in Afghanistan the threat of terrorist attack and insurgent violence remains as great as ever. May 2011 was the deadliest month for Afghan civilians since the U.N. began keeping records in 2007, the agency's Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported. June's death toll was almost as high.
Politicians should treat economic development deals as if they are spending their own money, carefully checking out each proposal, understanding that even the most deeply examined ones inherently are a gamble.

"The Maryland State Board of Education has already looked at this issue from this particular document and said it's not an education issue," Dyer said to Aquino.

The fact that Paul and Rachel Chandler couldn't pay a big ransom helped stretch out their ordeal to 388 agonizing days - until Sunday, when they were released, thin and exhausted but smiling.

Another find is the Chopra Center, which moved from La Jolla to the La Costa Resort. Deepak Chopra, the most popular evangelist of traditional Indian medicine, has his U.S. headquarters in a resort surrounded by tennis pros and polo-shirted golfers. For a while, Chopra was offering a way to integrate Indian mental centering techniques with golf – though I didn't see it on the spa menu. The materials did mention that those with a "pitta dosha" personality (one of the Ayurvedic body types) can be especially angry when they hit a bad shot. There is a full menu of yoga and meditation. It's a world within the La Costa world – and one that fits the word "east."
School construction manager Dave Tillou said there is good news. Some of the board’s professionals, such as its architect and engineers, are reducing their charges because, in part, “the job is getting done faster than anticipated.” The kitchen construction is finished and students were expected to be served hot meals on Tuesday for the first time this school year, said school superintendent Dr. Chrys Harttraft.

He was the spirit of the E Street Band, and the oaken staff that Bruce Springsteen leaned on.
Yet what is best for the rest of us isn’t necessarily what is best for Rondo. He’s 26. He still has some youthful defiance in him. He still has some youthful arrogance. He’s not Ray Allen. He’s not the personification of coolness and mature professionalism. Rondo can be brash. His teammates call him "Swag" for a reason. He does things like throw a ball at a referee in anger in February. He is young and stubborn. And that’s why he would stand there and not only resist saying he was sorry, but insist he had nothing to prove in this game.

A thought for all of us sentenced to a 24/7 news cycle wherein every comment, statement or aside is endlessly vetted: Give 'em a break. Presidential campaigns are political pressure cookers. Politicians are human beings. They can get tired, cranky and careless. They remind us that nobody is perfect. As much as we might like to revel in the difficulties of our political opponents, obvious misstatements should not become prime campaign fodder. Our unsettled economy and numerous military engagements around the world provide us plenty of real issues to debate. Given the high stakes involved, we can do better than this.

Wisconsin's Supreme Court race this spring is likely to intensify the already heated national debate over judicial selection in the states. From the hyperbolic rhetoric in media reports, one would think that the very legitimacy of state courts is at stake when ignorant voters are allowed to decide whether judges should retain their jobs. The New York Times editorial board lamented last month: "Whoever ultimately gets the job, all of Wisconsin has lost. This nasty, highly politicized race is raising serious questions about the impartiality of the state's highest court."

That's not to say that an Exelon-Constellation merger is a great thing. It still takes a corporate headquarters out of Baltimore, and as EDF officials have pointed out, it greatly diminishes the chances for the construction of a new nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs and will almost certainly result in the loss of high-paying jobs here. But the criteria on which the Public Service Commission can judge this deal are narrow: Does it provide benefits for BGE customers, does it produce no harm for them, and is it in the public interest? With the terms Mr. O'Malley secured, the commission should be able to answer all three in the affirmative.

There aren't that many tournaments, but there's two massive events on grass this year (in addition to its traditional tourney, Wimbledon will be the site of the Olympics tennis competition). I have done well on clay, but I do think I can play on grass as well."
"The Camry Effect": With over 7 million Toyota Camry drivers out there, the company wants the world to know that, yes, even YOU should drive one. George Clooney's narration only drives home the suggestion more.

"The elephant in the room here is opening up the West Coast to exporting coal to China," said Brett VandenHeuvel, Columbia Riverkeeper's executive director. "The fact that it's being ignored is hugely problematic. For us to simultaneously oppose coal plants here and happily export that coal to China is inconsistent."
Tom was born in Cassville, Mo., to John and Mable Mae (Peacock) Herd. The family moved to Gresham, where he graduated from Gresham High School in 1953.
I don't even talk to my neighbors because my neighbors don't talk to me. I have never been so, I guess, dishonored. My mother who is like 78, out in the yard picking stuff and people don't talk to her. I would never walk by a person who was older than me and not pay them the respect. It's almost like we are an inconvenience, like "You were here. Yes, we know you were here. But now we're here."
Gresham officials are advising against entry into the Columbia Slough downstream from Portal Way due to evidence of contamination.

A: The biggest thing people can do is just do as much research as they can on what is in their community. There are so many resources out there, but they're hard to navigate. And there have been a lot of cutbacks. It's pretty bleak. And at the very least, we need insurance legislation to go through and we have to figure out how do we help our children access treatment.
Private economists widely support the Fed's shift toward more transparency. Most dismiss concerns that the Fed, by being more open and specific in forecasting rates, might lock itself into wrongheaded policies.

Woodruff was fired Wednesday night, said Phyllis Kinsler, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Central Jersey.

MIT and Harvard officials emphasized that they would use the new online platform not just to build a global community of online learners but also to research teaching methods and technologies. Online courses with thousands of students give researchers the ability to monitor students' progress, they said, identifying what they click on and where they have trouble. Already, a researcher from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, using the MIT Circuits course, found that students overwhelmingly preferred to read the handwritten notes of Agarwal rather than the same notes presented on PowerPoint.

A school apparently at the other end of the spectrum is the music magnet at Hillside Elementary in Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw, where proficiency rates are 37% in English and 50% in math. Hillside magnet students are below the statewide average but well above average when compared with similar high-poverty, minority populations. And their proficiency rates are more than twice as high as those of the host school.

A quick online search demonstrated some of the near-legendary memories attached to those tournaments. On its alumni website, McBride High School gives major kudos to its team that won the 1939 Normandy tournament (and later the state championship).

I don't think so.
So it is encouraging that Gov. Jerry Brown is, like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger before him, appointing jurists that are more reflective of California's composition. Brown, in fact, deserves credit for having placed a new emphasis on diversity in bench appointments during his two terms as governor in the 1970s. But that was three decades ago. Why is there still such a lag?
Seattle-area tactical officers who slogged for hours over dangerously steep, muddy ground to find him were prepared, too. They pumped in tear gas, called for him over bullhorns, and, after 22 hours, on Saturday set off explosives along the top of the bunker.
"The potential is there," Horne said. "We've got some talent. We're definitely young. We've got some juniors. We've also got two freshmen who are going to play a lot for us, and a sophomore."
øSaldana, who left the Army in 2004, hasn't worked full time in 18 months. He's scoured "'help wanted" listings, taken college courses and earned an emergency medical technician certificate. But he finds himself pigeonholed. "What do you come out with having been an artillery man or in the infantry?" he asks. "The best job you can get is security. That's not what I want to do for the rest of my life."
5. Mix and match. It's not just OK to mix old with new; it's a new decor must. Caprara's living room combines modern-print sofas from West Elm with her refurbished thrift-store finds. The combination is warm, contemporary and one-of-a-kind.
No it wasn’t. It was a crazy, paranoid question. Four years ago, when a woman at one of his rallies began to rant about Barack Obama being an anti-American Muslim, presidential candidate John McCain took the microphone away and said she was wrong. Obama was a good American and a good family man with whom he simply disagreed, McCain said.

In Iran, rice pudding can be eaten as a meal on hot days, or as a token of respect at religious gatherings. Maykadeh, a Persian restaurant in North Beach, makes shola-e-zard, a saffron rice pudding, for special events. The cooks boil rice with sugar and water and add saffron, which turns the rice yellow, then add rose water and sugar to taste.
Another one of his employees also testified. Jim Duke, treasurer and controller at Executive Caterers, said he was made aware that the company issued two bills where 400-plus people attended political events for Dimora in 2006 -- but he did not know about it until after the corruption probe began.

FitzGerald sometimes would preface remarks with, "Let me tell you what I won't do. . . . Such responses leave to the imagination how he might fund economic development projects or address cries for change in the county's Department of Children and Family Services.

Roberto Hernandez was placed on baseball's restricted list after he was arrested in the Dominican Republic on false identity charges last month. Authorities have said Hernandez is 31, three years older than he claimed.
What Gould is saying is that in a world this over-saturated, where we are overwhelmed by either obligation or distraction, the most essential act is the emptiest, the one that forces us to face that there is nothing behind humanity's facade. "Not one of the works of art in the gallery," he says of an attack on the Tate Modern, "remotely matched the limitless potency of a terrorist bomb." And later: "To keep the world sane we depend on motive, we rely on cause and effect. Kick those props away and we see that the meaningless act is the only one that has any meaning."
ø"I don't know. We have to figure that out. Some way, somehow," Anthony said. Everybody's got to do it.
The two men wound up buying the Watts Towers, which led to the formation of a citizens committee in 1959 to preserve and exhibit the walled complex of spires — the tallest is nearly 100 feet — and other structures decorated with broken pottery, seashells, glazed tiles and pieces of colored glass.

The orbiter had originally been set to soar over New York and New Jersey on Monday. The flyover was postponed due to rain and wind.
Why has it taken so long for this film to get made? I call it a poisoned chalice. People have been trying to make movies about Bob Marley for years, both fictions films and documentaries. At least a dozen fiction films have come and gone, and some of them are still trying to get made. It's a very complex, litigious world, the world of Marley. A lot of different people own various rights, and you need to get everybody on your side. But in the end I was able to use the footage and songs I wanted on a reasonable budget.
Every time things get horrifying, though, we cut back to the tech wizards who are orchestrating the whole experience. The “scares” are therefore “ironic” and, being safely cordoned off behind these “quotation marks,” aren’t scary. While some of the one-liners are funny, the only reason I could think of to keep watching is to learn what the overarching reason behind the setup might be. When this answer is delivered, though, it’s weak, and it is given in the clunkiest possible way: A new character simply walks onscreen and explains the back story. Worse: It’s a celebrity cameo. Worse still: The “reveal” nullifies everything the protagonists have been trying to do.

"I hope to remind children and teachers alike that learning should be fun and can have positive effects far beyond the classroom, because we're trying to equip students with the ability to critically evaluate their own situation," Clark said. "It's not about getting them to remember all the facts, but showing them how to make the best decision by understanding their personal situation and gathering as much information as they can."
“We’re not Jeremy Lin,” said Olasewere, “but to have a city like that on our back, and to represent ’em in a tournament like this, it’s a blessing.”
Under the rules of racing, a horse that loses its rider during a race is either listed as a non-starter or a non-finisher or is automatically listed as coming in last. To the establishment, the idea of a horse crossing the wire alone is just about as preposterous as a jockey trotting to the finish without a mount.
Health insurance companies also must cover oral cancer drugs, treating them on a "no less favorable basis that intravenous anticancer medications," according to another bill Christie also signed.
"I didn't think I was going to have anybody because I had the fastest time by 30 seconds," Fischer said. "Then Courtney Rogers came up and led six laps. I was trying to stay calm because I knew she was going to try to take off. When we had 800 meters left, I was like, ‘OK, I have to go now.' I probably should have kicked harder too then. I just haven't been lately, I don't know why."

Salinger's other books don't equal the influence or sales of "Catcher," but they are still read, again and again, with great affection and intensity. Critics, at least briefly, rated Salinger as a more accomplished and daring short story writer than John Cheever.
His team felt differently – that was clear by how they reacted to the victory. They rushed closer Reynaldo Hernandez after he punctuated the victory by striking out Castano. Minutes later, they dumped the Gatorade bucket on Mandl and whatever was left on Corniel. It had nothing to do with the opponent, Rodriguez said. It was about winning a title.

So I thought I'd put together a list of my favorite baseball movies of all time. The two most important factors in compiling the list were that they had to be about baseball, and I had to be willing to watch them more than once.
“Do it. You’ve got to do it,” he said. “You’ve got to go through situations where you don’t have success to learn what you did wrong, the defining moments within a series where you have to find a way to get through it and be successful. That hasn’t happened here. I think we’ve added pieces over the last couple years that have been through that a little bit and that’s going to help this time around.

This week, I digress from my normal weekly rant about my household foibles and fiascos to bring you some actual breaking news: I met Martha Stewart.
Elias, by all accounts, had been playing well but was missing that tally. For a playmaker and goal-scorer, it built up some tension. It was visible to his teammates, who tried allaying him. But when your role is defined by numbers, their words weren’t as potent as goals.
Coming off a wave election of their own in 2010, Republicans need to add only four Senate seats (three, if they win the White House) to regain the majority. First-termers like Brown are prime targets, especially if they're also from states like Ohio, where President Barack Obama's approval ratings are underwater. Brown's unapologetic liberalism and often zealous partisanship make him an especially inviting target. In 34-year-old Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the GOP has a challenger with a strong personal story, little public record to attack, a proven ability to raise money and a willingness -- shown in 2010 -- to do whatever it takes to win.

Durga Nath takes out a battered suitcase filled with snake charmer memorabilia. He once traveled to Japan (a real "snakes on a plane") for a charmer publicity stunt, appeared in the 2010 Commonwealth Games' opening ceremony, and was summoned by authorities in 1999 when Hindu right-wingers threatened to release several slithery specimens during an India-Pakistan cricket match.

The parents, who met earlier Monday with Bloomington police, would particularly like to hear from Corey Rossman, one of the students who was with Lauren Spierer that night.
The critics have also wondered aloud - from radio and television sports shows to newspaper columns and even Monday-morning-quarterback perches - whether Tim Tebow has the right stuff to be an NFL quarterback. And though not always a Tebow believer, I've been born again by a young QB who continues somehow to find a way to win.
Ohio is on the right track with these bills. Pension forfeiture should be the rule, not the exception, when someone who is supposed to be serving the public betrays the public instead. The public should not have to finance the retirement of an employee or officeholder guilty of malfeasance.
Authorities say a man charged with the attempted murder of his girlfriend was a parole violator who had been released early from county jail because of overcrowding.
